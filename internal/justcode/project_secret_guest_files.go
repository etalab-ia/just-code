// Phase 3: managed guest dotenv files. Phase 2 registers the approved values
// with the Microsandbox proxy and exposes a marker under a guest variable.
// Many applications, though, read a dotenv file rather than the environment,
// and some frameworks load a different file per sub-project. This file renders
// the approved deliveries into those files and refuses to touch anything
// just-code did not write.
//
// Two kinds of value appear here, and they are not interchangeable. A
// proxy-protected binding contributes the opaque marker the guest environment
// already holds: the real value stays on the host and only the proxy
// substitutes it, only toward the approved destinations. A guest-readable
// binding contributes the real value, because nothing will substitute it — the
// application consumes it locally. Such a file is a secret: it is created
// 0600, it is marked in its header, and everything in the guest, including the
// agent, can read it. See docs/decisions/2026-10-15-guest-readable-secret-delivery.md.

// guestSecretHeaderPrefix marks a file just-code owns. The second line names
// the component so a human reading the guest can tell where it came from.
//
// The ownership check compares the digest of these 32 bytes plus the newline
// (guestSecretHeaderLineDigest), so changing this constant silently disables
// the check unless its digest is updated with it. assertGuestSecretHeaderDigest
// fails loudly on a mismatch, and a test pins it.

// it, an edit to the header would leave the ownership check comparing against a
// digest of the old text, every file would read as "not ours", and a
// reconciliation would rewrite good files — or, worse if the digest were
// regenerated carelessly, adopt foreign ones. A panic at import is the right
// blast radius: the process never serves a wrong answer.

// dotenvLiteral renders a value for a dotenv file, and reports whether the
// value can be represented unambiguously at all.
//
// dotenv has no single escaping that every loader agrees on, and this was
// measured against the loaders just-code pins (Node dotenv 16.4.7 with and
// without dotenv-expand 12.0.2, python-dotenv 1.2.2, godotenv 1.5.1):
//
//   - Single quotes preserve newlines, whitespace, "#", double quotes and an
//     interior backslash in every loader tested, so they are the encoding to
//     prefer; they are used whenever they work.
//   - A single quote inside the value cannot be escaped: godotenv then
//     refuses the whole file, and python-dotenv misparses it. A single quote
//     is therefore no obstacle to the raw fallback unless it stands first: an
//     unquoted value that begins with one (or with a double quote) is read as
//     a quoted value, which godotenv rejects outright and python-dotenv
//     misparses. Anywhere else it is an ordinary byte, so "it's" and
//     "C:\Users\O'Brien\" are deliverable raw.
//   - Two backslashes in a row are collapsed to one by python-dotenv when
//     quoted, silently. A trailing backslash escapes the closing quote:
//     godotenv refuses the whole file, and python-dotenv loses the value and
//     the next line, because every value in a generated file is followed by
//     another quoted value. Quoting cannot carry either shape.
//   - An unquoted (raw) value has no escape processing at all in any of the
//     three loaders, so a backslash pair and a trailing backslash round-trip
//     raw verbatim, which covers Windows and UNC paths and any value ending
//     in a directory separator. Raw is the fallback for every value quoting
//     cannot carry, not only those two shapes: an apostrophe also forces it,
//     as does any other value whose characters are measured to be safe raw.
//     Raw is a fallback, not the default: it is used only when quoting cannot
//     represent the value, so nothing already working changes form.
//   - Raw is safe only over a measured character set (see dotenvRawObstacle).
//     An unquoted value is ended by a newline or a carriage return, truncated
//     at a "#", expanded on "$", and read as a quoted value when it begins
//     with a single or double quote. Interior and trailing single quotes,
//     double quotes and backticks are ordinary bytes: measurement found that
//     plain Node dotenv strips only a matching quote pair around the whole
//     value, and only a wrapping backtick pair, so a lone leading backtick and
//     every interior or trailing quote round-trip verbatim. Everything else,
//     including every non-ASCII letter, mark, punctuation and symbol, is
//     carried verbatim: an unquoted value undergoes no decoding, so a path
//     such as C:\Répertoire\ or 秘密\ survives whole.
//   - A "$" followed by a name or "{" is expanded by dotenv-expand and by
//     godotenv, and the usual escape, "\$", is then left as a literal
//     backslash by plain Node dotenv and rejected by python-dotenv. So a
//     value containing "$" cannot be delivered through dotenv syntax without
//     picking one loader's semantics and breaking another's. Any "$" is
//     refused, including the trailing positions where it would in fact be
//     inert, because the safe positions depend on the characters that follow
//     and a rule that reproduces three loaders' expansion grammars is a
//     liability, not a feature: a "$" is either a literal or an expansion
//     depending on the loader, and a wrong guess alters a secret.
//
// Values that cannot be represented are refused rather than written: a
// mangled secret is worse than a refused one, because it fails silently and
// far from here.

// last character when it is a stripped character. A value whose first and last
// characters are both backticks is also refused. The value must be non-empty.
//
// The set was measured, not assumed. A sweep over every assigned code point,
// placed at the leading, trailing and interior position of a value in a
// generated file (the raw value between two quoted values), run through all
// three pinned loaders plus dotenv-expand, found the interior failures above
// and an edge-trim set that is the union of what each loader strips:
//
//	unicode.IsSpace(r)                        (Go, Python and Node all strip these)
//	+ U+001C..U+001F                          (Python's str.isspace, not Go's)
//	+ U+FEFF                                  (Node's trim)
//
// An interior occurrence of a whitespace character is left alone by every
// loader, so only the edges are constrained: a tab or a NBSP inside the value
// is exact, while the same character at the end would be dropped silently.
//
// Quotes and backticks are positional, not forbidden. Only a single or double
// quote standing first is unsafe: it opens a quoted value, so godotenv refuses
// the whole file ("unterminated quoted value") and python-dotenv misparses it.
// Everywhere else a quote is an ordinary byte. Plain Node dotenv strips a
// quote pair only when the same quote character wraps the whole value, and it
// treats a backtick like a quote in that one check, so an interior or trailing
// quote or backtick, a lone leading backtick, and even a backtick-wrapped value
// are preserved by the raw loaders — but a value wrapped in a matching backtick
// pair is refused by this predicate because Node, unlike Python and Go, would
// strip the pair. That is a limit of the raw form alone: the quoted form carries
// the value, so such a value is refused only when something else has already
// ruled quoting out.
//
// Non-ASCII is not a reason to refuse. Unlike a quoted value, an unquoted one
// is never decoded, so UTF-8 bytes pass through as written and a path such as
// C:\Répertoire\, naïve\ or 秘密\ round-trips exactly in all three loaders.
// Refusing them would reject the majority of the world's file names for a
// hazard that only exists inside quotes.
//
// Invalid UTF-8 never reaches this predicate: dotenvLiteral checks the whole
// value once, before either form, because a quoted invalid byte is refused by
// python-dotenv and can even swallow the next line in godotenv.

// observeGuestSecretFile reports the three facts a publish decision needs about
// one guest path, without reading the file's content.
//
// This is the result of a measured constraint rather than a preference. The
// runtime persists the stdout of guest executions in a host log
// (`logs/exec.log` under `MSB_HOME`; see
// docs/decisions/2026-10-15-guest-readable-secret-delivery.md), so a `cat` of a
// managed file copies that plaintext — the real value — into a host log that
// survives the sandbox. The comparison therefore never prints the file. The
// guest prints only:
//
//   - whether the file exists,
//   - whether its first line is just-code's header (the header is a constant,
//     not a secret),
//   - one token, and only when the file's digest equals the digest just-code
//     wants there.
//
// The comparison runs inside the guest and never prints its inputs: the
// expected digest arrives on the command's **standard input**, not as an
// argument, because the runtime records exec argv in the same log as stdout. A
// content digest is not a secret, but it is derived from one, and for a value
// with little entropy — a short password, or one drawn from a small set — a
// recorded digest would be enough to test guesses offline. Keeping it out of
// argv costs nothing.
//
// The file's first line is compared as a **byte stream**, never through a shell
// variable. Command substitution is not byte-transparent: both bash and dash
// discard NUL bytes from it, so a file whose first line is
// `# just-code mana\0ged: do not edit` would come back as just-code's marker
// and be treated as ours. `grep -qxF` compares the bytes as they are, which
// makes the check an equality test rather than an approximation of one.
//
// A path that is genuinely absent is reported absent. A path that exists but
// cannot be read is an error, not an absence: treating it as absence would
// turn a conflict with the project's own file into an overwrite.
