// Lima 1.0.x has no `template` subcommand: `limactl validate` there treats its
// argument as a filesystem path, so it rejects every locator form that
// `limactl create` resolves happily (`template://debian-12`, an https URL).
// Probing the subcommand's help answers the question the caller actually has —
// "can this limactl check the image?" — without parsing a version string that
// would need updating for every future release.

// An image that Lima cannot resolve fails the build several minutes in, after

// discarded. Checking it first turns that into one line naming the variable,
// the value, and Lima's own diagnostic.
//
// The check is best-effort by design: when this limactl cannot validate
// locators, the image is not rejected for it. Refusing to build on a Lima that
// simply lacks the subcommand would break every 1.0.x install over a check
// that did not exist there.

	// A failed check does not yet say the image is wrong: limactl refuses to
	// run at all for some callers (`must not run as the root user`), and that
	// refusal arrives on this same command. In Lima 1.x that gate sits in a
	// PersistentPreRunE on the root command, so it applies to every subcommand
	// while --help bypasses it — which is why the capability probe above
	// passes as root. A subcommand that carries no image therefore fails
	// identically and serves as a witness.
	//
	// Lima 2.x moved the same gate to a panic at the top of main(), which
	// --help does not bypass, so as root the probe exits non-zero and this
	// check reports "unsupported" instead. That path skips validation rather
	// than witnessing it, and is harmless: as root on 2.x every limactl call
	// panics, so the build fails on its own with Lima's message before this
	// check could matter.
	//
	// `info` is that subcommand: it reads the template store, `limayaml` and
	// LimaHome — the same inputs `template validate` needs — so it fails when
	// they are unavailable, and it touches no instance state, so a leftover
	// instance cannot make it fail. Probing the default image instead would
	// leave this undiagnosed whenever the configured image IS the default,
	// which is the common case and the one that reported the bug.
	//
	// A failing witness is inconclusive rather than proof of a shared cause,
	// so neither failure is attributed to AGENT_VM_IMAGE and both diagnostics
	// are reported. The witness can indeed fail for a reason that has nothing
	// to do with the configured image — `info` reads the template store,
	// `default.yaml` and LimaHome, so a broken store fails it while a
	// genuinely bad image also fails the validation. Nothing cheap separates
	// those two: Lima exits non-zero in both cases, and matching the refusal text
	// would tie the attribution to Lima's wording, which is exactly the
	// fragility the witness exists to avoid. The result therefore reports
	// that no verdict is available rather than asserting either cause.
	// Only paid on failure.
