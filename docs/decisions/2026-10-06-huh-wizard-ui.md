# 2026-10-06: huh-based wizard UI

## Context

Every interactive prompt in the CLI (the `init` wizard, the global `setup`
wizard, `auth add`, and the launch-path "Configure it now?" offer) rendered
as sequential line prompts. On a terminal this is a long, busy wall of
questions (issue #133): the user answers one question per line, with no
grouping, no selection UI for the skills catalogue, and no way to revise an
earlier answer except restarting.

## Decision

Interactive terminals run the wizards as `charmbracelet/huh` forms:

- One form per wizard, grouped by concern (placement, runtime, model and
  resources, credentials, skills, MCPs and storage). Groups whose answers
  the command line already supplied are hidden (`WithHideFunc` on
  `opts.Set`), preserving the "flags answer questions" contract.
- The skills catalogue and MCP list render as filterable `MultiSelect`
  fields; the review step renders as a huh `Select` with apply, edit
  (reopens the form with the current answers as defaults), and cancel.
- Secrets (`auth add`, the setup wizard's Albert and GitHub prompts) render
  as huh `Input` fields in `EchoModePassword`.

The line-based prompts remain the non-interactive contract, unchanged: a
piped stdin, a script, or a test drives the same `promptLine`/`promptSecret`
flow with the same semantics. The routing seam is `wizardHuhFn` (both stdin
and stdout must be terminals); tests stub it to false, the same pattern as
`stdinIsTTYFn`.

## Consequences

- `huh` v2 becomes a direct dependency (bubbletea, lipgloss, and their
  transitive requirements follow).
- A terminal with stdin piped but stdout attached keeps the line path, so
  `just-code init < answers.txt` in a real terminal still works.
- The non-TTY contract is untouched: with no terminal, `init` still fails
  naming the missing flags rather than waiting.
