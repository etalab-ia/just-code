# agentvm-base-prep: provisions the just-code agent-vm base template.
#
# Runs inside the base VM as the regular user (piped in by
# `limactl shell <template> sh -s`), invoking sudo for system-level changes.
# Running as the user matters: OpenCode installs under $HOME, which is root's
# home if the script itself runs as root.
#
# just-code builds this template itself so it never has to execute a
# third-party provisioning script that cannot be pinned to a release.
#
# Scope is deliberately minimal: base packages plus the toolchain the backend
# needs. Anything else (Docker, Chromium, other agent CLIs, MCP wiring)
# belongs in a user-maintained template referenced through AGENT_VM_TEMPLATE.
